# Contents of this directory

This directory is to contain all the generated JavaDoc-Documentation that is produced during the build process that
is triggered by the command "mvn clean package" in the root of the checked out kitodo.production project.

There should be further investigations concerning the generation of UML diagrams as part of the JavaDoc-generation. Many of the 
UML diagrams provided in the documentation just seem to illustrate the results of the JavaDoc generation.

There seem to be a lot of projects that cover the subject of UML generation. EX.: [generate UMLs in JavaDoc automatically](http://gochev.blogspot.de/2011/03/generate-javadoc-with-uml-diagrams.html)
